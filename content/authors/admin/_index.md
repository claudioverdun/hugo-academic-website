I am an applied mathematician, currently in the 5th year of my PhD studies, with an interest in how data extract from certain applications can be exploited in a provable way. Despite all \emph{models being wrong, some are useful}, and the notion of parsimonious models is one of the core topics of my research. In particular, I use techniques from the fields of (non-convex) optimization, statistics, numerical linear algebra and computational harmonic analysis to exploit data. My research focuses on developing and analyzing \textbf{sparse and low-rank models}, \textbf{probabilistic methods in data analysis and uncertainty quantification for high-dimensional statistics}, \textbf{iteratively reweighted algorithms} as well as applications to \textbf{MRI}. Recently, I also started working with the fascinating \textbf{implicit bias of the gradient descent} phenomenon.}}
