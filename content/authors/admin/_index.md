I am an applied mathematician with an interest in how data extract from certain applications can be exploited in a provable way. Despite all *models being wrong, some are useful*, and the notion of parsimonious models is one of the core topics of my research. In particular, I use techniques from the fields of (non-convex) optimization, statistics, numerical linear algebra and computational harmonic analysis to exploit data. My research focuses on developing and analyzing *sparse and low-rank models*, *probabilistic methods* in data analysis and uncertainty quantification for high-dimensional statistics, *iteratively reweighted algorithms* as well as applications to **MRI**. Recently, I also started working with the fascinating **implicit bias of the gradient descent** phenomenon.
