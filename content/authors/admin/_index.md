I am interested in machine learning, compressive sensing, inverse problems, optimization and high-dimensional
statistics. My goal is to develop an understanding of ML from first principles, to establish provable guarantees for its
algorithms, and to apply them to medical technology problems. I'm currently interested in sparse and low-rank models,
implicit bias of the gradient descent, probabilistic methods in data analysis and uncertainty quantification
for high-dimensional statistics, iteratively reweighted algorithms as well as applications to MRI, one of my scientific passions.
